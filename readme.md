# React Mobile

React Mobile is a starter kit for building mobile-only web apps. The technology stack assumes the app will be packaged into a WebView.

`react` and `react-router` are used to handle the UI and page transitions. `hammerjs` and `scroll` are used for screen interaction.

Data stores are built with `ampersand-model` and `ampersand-collection`.

Any HTTP requests are made with `superagent`.

## Build

Use `npm run build` to compile the application.
